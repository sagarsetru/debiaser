### Context

Some people are eager to get news from outside of their echo chamber. However, they do not know where to go outside of their echo chambers, and may also have some activation energy when it comes to seeking information from other sources. In the meantime, social media invariably pushes you content that you agree with. You end up in an echo chamber, but may not have ever wanted to be in one in the first place.

### Need

A way to find news articles from different yet reliable media sources.

### Vision

Debiaser, a chrome extension that will recommend news articles similar in topic to the one currently being read, but from several pre-curated and reliable news media organizations across the political spectrum, for example, following the "media bias chart" here https://www.adfontesmedia.com/ or the "media bias ratings" here: https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-ratings. The app will determine the main topics of the text of a news article, and then show links to similar articles from other news organizations.

The product will generate topics for a given document via latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and then search news websites using the words with the highest probabilities of being associated with topics.

### Outcome

People who are motivated to engage in content outside of their echo chambers have a tool that enables them to quickly find news similar to what they are currently reading, but from a variety of news organizations.
