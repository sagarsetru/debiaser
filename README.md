### Context

Some people are eager to get news from outside of their echo chamber. However, they do not know where to go outside of their echo chambers, and may also have some activation energy when it comes to seeking information from other sources. In the meantime, most newsfeeds only push you content that you agree with. You end up in an echo chamber, but may not have ever wanted to be in one in the first place.
